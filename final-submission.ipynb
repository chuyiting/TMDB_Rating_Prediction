    "We use the **TMDB Movie Metadata** dataset from Kaggle, which contains over 5,000 films with metadata such as genres, keywords, cast, crew, budgets, revenues, text descriptions, and popularity statistics.  \n",
    "Our goal is to **predict the movie’s average user rating (`vote_average`)**, a continuous value between 0 and 10.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We aim to predict **`vote_average`** from structured metadata and text features.\n",

    "Our baselines and models include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Baseline:** global average rating per genre  \n",
    "- Feature-engineered similarity models  \n",
    "- Text-based representations  \n",
    "- LLM-based regression models  \n",

    "### Model Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "We assess the validity of our predictions through:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Held-out test metrics**  \n",
    "   - RMSE and MAE indicate how close predictions are to true ratings.  \n",
    "   - Lower values → better generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Baseline comparison**  \n",
    "   - Models must outperform the **global genre-average predictor** to be considered meaningful.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error analysis**  \n",
    "   - Reviewing films with large prediction errors to understand failures and potential noise.\n",
